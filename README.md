## Hello!

I'm a frontend developer with 4+ YOE. This is where I will share and host some of my personal projects.


## Overview of Projects

### 1. [PracticeKanji.com](https://www.practicekanji.com/)
- A simple customizable Kanji App with over 2400+ JLPT Kanjis and 10,000+ vocabulary examples. It's a passion project that I made for my 6 year old Nephew ( who is currently studying English, Mandarin and Japanese ) to improve his Japanese reading skills.

#### Roadmap
1. Improve data to include more examples, especially for N1 Kanjis as they're missing.
2. Add more quiz options and customizations.
3. Japanese AI Chatbot.
